# How do partition the partitions the right way

Requirements:
- Unlocked bootloader
- [The app](https://github.com/VendDair/VoA-Helper/releases)

So you need to know that android may not work normally after partitioning so make an backup of your data.

First open the app.

Press *Install Windows* button and *partition* button.

If you are 100% sure that you want to do that press *continue*

Then write how much space you want to allocate for windows

And press *enter* on your keyboard.

Wait a bit and now youre good to go!

You can reboot into twrp in order to format data in order for android to work properly or just install windows and then do android stuff you need.
